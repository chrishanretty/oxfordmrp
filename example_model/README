This folder contains code to generate MRP estimates of preferences for
PR at the constituency level.

Please note that this is a teaching example, and that some features
which make it good as a teaching example (small realized sample size)
may make it a poor guide to actual preferences.

Please do not redistribute the files in `data/`, which were produced
by the British Election Study team. If you use these files, please
cite the team appropriately.
