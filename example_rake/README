This folder contains R scripts necessary to generate joint
distributions for Scottish Parliamentary Constituencies.

The folder contains four scripts:

 - 01_get_spc_margins.R
 - 02_vi_imputation_model.R
 - 03_create_joint_dist.R
 - 04_rake.R

Script `01_get_spc_margins.R` gets (univariate) distributions for
seven different variables (age, gender, highest qualifications,
ethnicity, SOC2010 category, private/public sector employment, and
2016 vote). It relies on small area population estimates contained in
`data/spc-19-tabs_2019.csv`, margins from the Labour Force
Survey/Annual Population Survey, obtained through Nomisweb.co.uk, and
electoral results from the Electoral Commission.

Script `02_vi_imputation_model.R` estimates a multinomial model of
vote choice on data from the 2016 Scottish Election Study panel
data. The model uses as predictor variables age, gender, highest
qualifications, and ethnicity.

Script `03_create_joint_dist.R` reads in the most recent microdata
from the Labour Force Survey/Annual Population Survey, imputes vote
choice, and then coarsens some variables (like age).

Finally, script `04_rake.R` takes the joint (Scotland-wide)
distribution created by script `03_create_joint_dist.R`, and rakes it
to constituency margins one after another.
